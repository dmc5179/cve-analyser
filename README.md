# cve-analyser
A tool to analyse the list of detected CVEs in the containers (usually created by static security scanner) and compare them to the Red Hat Security Data. 
The cve-analyser can find fixes in the rpm packages used in the specified container, as well as the fixes in the non-rpm content (like nodejs libraries). 

It is possible to specify a keyword as a affected component (instead of container name) and then cve-analyser will show all Red Hat products where component/package name contain a specified word in the validated checked CVE id.  

## As a parameter it requires a csv file with two arguments in each line:
- CVE  
- Red Hat container image information  or Package name


Like:  
`CVE-2021-33503,ubi8/ubi:8.4-211`  

    The Red Hat container image name must be provided in format visible also in the Red Hat Container Catalog page (https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?p=1) where first is specified the repository name, then after the "/" is the container name and after ":" is the image version.  

or

`CVE-2021-23337,kibana`

    The as a second parameter is provided a package name, cve-analyser will search for any results for a specified name, it means that if there is a container with a name similar to the specified name, such container will be also displayed in the findings output.  
    For example, if in the input will contains lines like below:  
    ```
    CVE-2021-23337,openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6:v4.6.0-202109071652.p0.git.d578b18.assembly.stream
    CVE-2021-23337,kibana
    ```
    The output from the cve-analyser for each line will be:  
    ```
    CVE-2021-23337 | openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6:v4.6.0-202109071652.p0.git.d578b18.assembly.stream | Moderate | (Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4,Will not fix,openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6)
    CVE-2021-23337 | kibana | Moderate | (Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11,Will not fix,kibana)(Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4,Will not fix,kibana)(Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4,Will not fix,openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6)
    ```
    The image openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6 is displayed twice. Once as a result for the exact container searching, second time as a name what contains `kibana` word.  


The second notation is useful when you want to find any products and their container images or packages with a specific name as a affected component.  
By default it's recommended to use first notation, with the exact container name as a component. That will show more accurate results.
