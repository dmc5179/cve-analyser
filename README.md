# cve-analyser
A tool to analyse the list of detected CVEs in the containers (usually created by static security scanner) and compare them to the Red Hat Security Data.

As a parameter it requires a csv file with two arguments in each line:
- CVE  
- Red Hat container image information  
Like:  
`CVE-2021-33503,ubi8/ubi:8.4-211`
The Red Hat container image name must be provided in format visible also in the Red Hat Container Catalog page (https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?p=1) where first is specified the repository name, then after the "/" is the container name and after ":" is the image version.
